# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Coursera Course Project for the class "Getting and Cleaning Data"

This repository contains the following files:

## cleandata.txt
A tidy dataset (one observation per row, one variable per column) containing the mean value of each measurement in the original dataset by activity and subject. This file is formatted with one space between each piece of data, and there is no header.

## Codebook.md 
An R markdown file explaining the variables in the clean data file and the data transformations performed on the raw data.

## run_analysis.R
An R script that ingests, cleans, and transforms the original data to output the cleandata.txt file.
