The cleandata.txt file in this repository contains cleaned and transformed data derived from the UCIHAR dataset available at the following link:

To build this new dataset, the training and test datasets were merged and only variables expressing a mean or standard deviation were retained. Subject and feature name information was added to the file, and the activity variable was expanded to a descriptive name.
The data was then grouped by subject and activity, and an average (mean) was calculated for each feature. In the resultant dataset, each row represents the observed averages for each activity per subject across all of the retained variables.

Column one in the dataset contains the ID number of the subject, column two contains the name of the activity being performed by the subject. All column names were taken from the original features of the dataset, with the obvious distinction that in this dataset, they represent averages for their feature for a given subject and a given activity.

The column names are as follows:

 [1] "subject"                             
 [2] "activity"
